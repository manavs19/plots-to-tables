current approach: find all rect, remove outer rects, take only those rect that have colour and merge them together

find all rect, remove outer rects, iterate block by block(5*5) instead of pixel by pixel and see central pixel for colour

find coloured pixels first, do clustering(bfs maybe, better approach??), expand the bounding rect found, now find rectangles inside each cluster and then discretize.
